    "\n",
    "By considering historical information such as pick up and drop off date, hour and geo-localization, and trip duration regarding taxi trips, the objective is to predict the duration of each taxi trip given in a specific test set, which does not present neither drop off time, nor trip duration. The prediction will be performed through a supervised learning regressor to be defined given the data structure."

    "The challenge provides two [data sets].\n",
    "* train.csv - the training set, which contains 1.458.644 observations\n",
    "* test.csv - the testing set, which contains 625.134 observations\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set contains eleven features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `id` - a unique identifier for each trip\n",
    "* `vendor_id` - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record\n",
    "* `pickup_datetime` - date and time when the meter was engaged\n",
    "* `dropoff_datetime` - date and time when the meter was disengaged\n",
    "* `passenger_count` - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)\n",
    "* `pickup_longitude` - the longitude where the meter was engaged\n",
    "* `pickup_latitude` - the latitude where the meter was engaged\n",
    "* `dropoff_longitude` - the longitude where the meter was disengaged\n",
    "* `dropoff_latitude` - the latitude where the meter was disengaged\n",
    "* `store_and_fwd_flag` - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server - Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip\n",
    "* `trip_duration` - duration of the trip in seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing set doesn't have neither the `trip_duration`, target variable, nor the `dropoff_datetime`. So,the model should be trained on the training set, and predict the `trip_duration` for the testing set observations. The predictions should be [submitted to the Kaggle's challenge] for calculating the final score.\n",

    "# Project Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will be segregated in four major parts: data preprocessing, model selection, benchmark comparison and conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing will be segregated into two sections: Generals and Specifics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, data quality will be considered and performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there any missing values?\n",
    "* The features are formatted on a convenient way?\n",
    "* Is there any unnecessary information?\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with that, from the features `pickup_latitude`, `pickup_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude` and `dropoff_longitude`, the feature `distance` will be calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the data will be explored statistically and visually, with the objective of understanding the features influences, detecting and dropping outliers and finding transformations that will make the training and prediction better, as rescalling or *one-hot-encoding*, for example. This analysis will be divided in four subsections: Distance anaysis, Geo-localization analysis, Time related analysis and the remaining features analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the analysis, the velocity will be calculated, `distance` over `trip_duration` as the trip duration may depend on traffic, that depends greatly on date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This parte will train the models and consider the RMSLE scoring for choosing the best one. As the testing set provided doesn't have the target feature, `trip_duration`, the training set will be splitted into training and testing set for the model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial model evaluation, a set of different kind regressors will be trained in different data set sizes, using cross validation, in order to verify underfitting and overfitting between regressors. No tunning of hyperparameters will be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Tunning\n",
    "\n",
    "The best model from the previous step will have its hyperparameters tunned through gridsearch in order to select the best hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once chosen the best model, it must pass through a set of final validations in order to check its robustness. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmark Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model has been selected and trained on the whole provided training set, the predictions over the provided testint set will be submitted to the private [leaderboard] on Kaggle. The result will be comparised with the bechmark, which is `0.28976`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[leaderboard]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/leaderboard\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The last section it is the conclusion with a reflextion about the data, the model and a proposal possible improvements."
