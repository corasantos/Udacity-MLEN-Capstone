\section{Domain Background}\label{domain-background}}

The chosen project for the Capstone Project is the
\href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration}{New York City
Taxi Duration Trip} competition from
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle}{Kaggle}. The challenge is to
build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New
York City.

    \hypertarget{problem-statement}{%
\subsubsection{2. Problem Statement}\label{problem-statement}}

By considering historical information such as pick up and drop off date,
hour and geo-localization, and trip duration regarding taxi trips, the
objective is to predict the duration of each taxi trip given in a
specific test set, which does not present neither drop off time, nor
trip duration. The prediction will be performed through a supervised
learning regressor to be defined given the data structure.

    \hypertarget{datasets-and-inputs}{%
\subsubsection{3. Datasets and Inputs}\label{datasets-and-inputs}}

The challenge provides two
\href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data}{data sets}.
* train.csv - the training set, which contains 1.458.644 observations *
test.csv - the testing set, which contains 625.134 observations

The training set contains eleven features:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{id} - a unique identifier for each trip
\item
  \texttt{vendor\_id} - a code indicating the provider associated with
  the trip record
\item
  \texttt{pickup\_datetime} - date and time when the meter was engaged
\item
  \texttt{dropoff\_datetime} - date and time when the meter was
  disengaged
\item
  \texttt{passenger\_count} - the number of passengers in the vehicle
  (driver entered value)
\item
  \texttt{pickup\_longitude} - the longitude where the meter was engaged
\item
  \texttt{pickup\_latitude} - the latitude where the meter was engaged
\item
  \texttt{dropoff\_longitude} - the longitude where the meter was
  disengaged
\item
  \texttt{dropoff\_latitude} - the latitude where the meter was
  disengaged
\item
  \texttt{store\_and\_fwd\_flag} - This flag indicates whether the trip
  record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because
  the vehicle did not have a connection to the server - Y=store and
  forward; N=not a store and forward trip
\item
  \texttt{trip\_duration} - duration of the trip in seconds
\end{itemize}

The testing set doesn't have neither the \texttt{trip\_duration}, target
variable, nor the \texttt{dropoff\_datetime}. So,the model should be
trained on the training set, and predict the \texttt{trip\_duration} for
the testing set observations. The predictions should be
\href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/submit}{submitted
to the Kaggle's challenge} for calculating the final score.

The variables \texttt{pickup\_latitude}, \texttt{pickup\_longitude},
\texttt{dropoff\_latitude} and \texttt{dropoff\_longitude} will be used
to calculate the trip distance between the pickup and dropoff locations.
Also, they are important and will be analysed because where in NY the
each trip starts and ends influences greatly the velocity in which the
taxi can travel.

The variables \texttt{pickup\_datetime} are important, and also will be
analysed profoundly, because the moment on time in which the trips occur
also influences greatly the the taxi velocity.

The remaining variables will be analysed in order to conclude about
their influence on the target variable.

The data sets provided by the Kaggle challenge were made avaiable in
\href{https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/nyc-tlc-trips}{Big
Query on Google Cloud Platform}, originally published by
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page}{NYC
Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)}.

    \hypertarget{solution-statement}{%
\section{Solution Statement}\label{solution-statement}}

The solution will be provided by a regression method. The optimization
will be performed after a preprocessing of the data and through
minimization of the root mean square logarithm error (RMSLE), cross
validation for detecting over and/or underfitting, and grid-search for
fine tunning hyperparameters.

    \hypertarget{benchmark-result}{%
\section{Benchmark Result}\label{benchmark-result}}

The benchmark result is the
\href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/leaderboard}{winning}
score of the Kaggle's challenge when the winning team submitted the
provided testing set. The challenge's metric is the RMSLE, and the
winning score is \texttt{0.28976}.

\section{Evaluation Metrics}\label{evaluation-metrics}}

The evaluation metric is the one from the Kaggle's challenge,
\href{https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-an-RMSE-and-RMSLE-logarithmic-error-and-does-a-high-RMSE-imply-low-RMSLE}{RMSLE},
in order to make the score comparable to the benchmark result. The
metric is quite similar to the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation}{root
mean squared error}, however, considers the squared difference of the
logarithm values of prediction (\(\hat{y}\)) and true values(\(y\)).

\[\text{RMSLE}(y,\hat{y}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_k{\text{log}(1+y_k)-\text{log}(1+\hat{y}_k)}}\]

    \hypertarget{project-design}{%
\section{Project Design}\label{project-design}}

The project will be segregated in four major parts: data preprocessing, model selection, benchmark comparison and conclusion.


\hypertarget{data-preprocessing}{%
\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\label{data-preprocessing}}

Data preprocessing will be segregated into two sections: Generals and Specifics.

\hypertarget{generals}{%
\subsubsection{Generals}\label{generals}}

In this section, data quality will be considered and performed.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Are there any missing values?
\item
  The features are formatted on a convenient way?
\item
  Is there any unnecessary information?
\end{itemize}

Along with that, from the features \texttt{pickup\_latitude},
\texttt{pickup\_longitude}, \texttt{dropoff\_latitude} and
\texttt{dropoff\_longitude}, the feature \texttt{distance} will be
calculated.

\hypertarget{specifics}{%
\subsubsection{Specifics}\label{specifics}}

In this section, the data will be explored statistically and visually,
with the objective of understanding the features influences, detecting
and dropping outliers and finding transformations that will make the
training and prediction better, as rescalling or
\emph{one-hot-encoding}, for example. This analysis will be divided in
four subsections: Distance anaysis, Geo-localization analysis, Time
related analysis and the remaining features analysis.

For the analysis, the velocity will be calculated, \texttt{distance}
over \texttt{trip\_duration} as the trip duration may depend on traffic,
that depends greatly on date and time.

\hypertarget{model-selection}{%
\subsection{Model Selection}\label{model-selection}}

This parte will train the models and consider the RMSLE scoring for
choosing the best one. As the testing set provided doesn't have the
target feature, \texttt{trip\_duration}, the training set will be
splitted into training and testing set for the model selection.

\hypertarget{initial-model-evaluation}{%
\subsubsection{Initial Model
Evaluation}\label{initial-model-evaluation}}

For the initial model evaluation, a set of different kind regressors
will be trained in different data set sizes, using cross validation, in
order to verify underfitting and overfitting between regressors. No
tunning of hyperparameters will be performed.

\hypertarget{model-tunning}{%
\subsubsection{Model Tunning}\label{model-tunning}}

The best model from the previous step will have its hyperparameters
tunned through gridsearch in order to select the best hyperparameters.

\hypertarget{final-validation}{%
\subsubsection{Final Validation}\label{final-validation}}

Once chosen the best model, it must pass through a set of final
validations in order to check its robustness.

\hypertarget{benchmark-comparison}{%
\subsection{Benchmark Comparison}\label{benchmark-comparison}}

Once the model has been selected and trained on the whole provided
training set, the predictions over the provided testint set will be
submitted to the private
\href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/leaderboard}{leaderboard}
on Kaggle. The result will be comparised with the bechmark, which is
\texttt{0.28976}.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

The last section it is the conclusion with a reflextion about the data,
the model and a proposal possible improvements.
